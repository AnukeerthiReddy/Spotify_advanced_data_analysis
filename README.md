This project dives into Spotify's comprehensive dataset (spanning 1957 to 2020) to uncover the factors that define the   popularity of a song. By leveraging machine learning techniques and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) insights, this analysis  explores correlations between track popularity and musical features like acoustics, danceability, and loudness.  
  
The work blends advanced technical analysis with a strong focus on storytelling and visualization, enabling actionable insights   into the dynamics of music popularity across different genres and time periods. 

## **Technical Highlights**  

### **Data Analysis & Machine Learning**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - Analyzed 32,833 rows of Spotify data across 23 features.  
  - Explored distributions of track popularity by genre, time period, and audio features.  

- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Normalized track popularity to identify key features influencing song success.  
  - Selected acoustics, danceability, loudness, energy, and valence as critical predictors.  

- **Machine Learning**:  
  - Utilized the **Random Forest Classifier** to predict track popularity with an accuracy of 85%.  
  - Tackled multi-class classification for genres like Pop, Latin, and Rap.  

- **SHAP Analysis**:  
  - Used SHAP values to interpret feature importance in the Random Forest model, explaining how features like tempo, danceability, and speechiness contribute to predictions.  

### **Visualization & Communication**  
- Created compelling visualizations (e.g., genre trends, feature correlations) to communicate findings effectively.  
- Highlighted key insights such as the rising popularity of EDM and the dominance of Pop, Latin, and Rap genres.  
- Designed an aesthetically engaging poster to summarize the project for a general audience.

## **Key Findings**  
1. **Genre Trends**:  
   - Pop, Latin, and Rap dominate track popularity, with EDM showing significant recent growth.  
   - Genres like R&B and Rock exhibit comparatively lower popularity.  

2. **Feature Importance**:  
   - Acoustics, Danceability, and Loudness correlate strongly with track popularity.  
   - Energy and valence positively affect popularity, while loudness has a notable negative impact in specific contexts.  

3. **Artist Success**:  
   - Artists like Martin Garrix, Chainsmokers, and David Guetta stand out across multiple genres.
